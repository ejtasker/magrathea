# Design your world

In Magrathea, you are the designer of a new system of planets. From the birth of your star,
you make the decisions that will determine how your planetary system evolves, and what new worlds result.

<!-- Maybe you'll create a twin to our own Solar System, with one or more potentially habitable planets.
Or perhaps your choices will systems of huge gaseous worlds hotter than Mercury, or ones where the planets are ejected entirely
to wander alone through the galaxy.

For some of the choices, scientists understand how different environments come about. But for other choices,
we're not exactly sure why and when they occur, we have just observed different options. For these cases,
you will roll a dice to select the outcome. -->

As far as possible, the choices and outcomes in this game are based on the latest observations and theories on how planets
form and evolve. References to journal papers are included throughout this text, if you would like to explore the background behind the game.
